## Twitter Sentimental Analysis of US Airlines 
This is a sentiment classification project using the Kaggle-available Twitter US Airlines Sentiments Dataset. It is a collection of tweets on US airlines. It also includes the ID of the tweet, the sentiment of the message (neutral, negative, or good), the reasons for the bad tweet, the name of the airline, and the content of the tweet. By combining neutral and positive tweets into a single category, the problem is presented below as a binary classification problem. An appropriate exploratory data analysis was performed, then the dataset was trained to RandomForest Classifier and generated the Classification report.
